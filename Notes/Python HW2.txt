print(ls,fs) #prints last name and first name in reverse with space

#2
n = input("Type in a number. I will calculate n + nn+ nnn") #n will be input as a string to so I will need to convert it to int
nn = int(n+n) #concatenates n to display "nn". starts as a string so I will convert it to an int
nnn = int(n+n+n)
n = int(n)
print(n+nn+nnn)

x = 10
y = 50
if (x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100): 
    print(x, y)
#There is no output because x^2 is equal to exactly 100, not less.

#5
a = [10, 20]
b = a
b += [30, 40]
print(a)
print(b)
# the output is
